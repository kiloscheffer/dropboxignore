# Post-v0.2 follow-ups

Items surfaced by the 2026-04-20 simplify-review pass that weren't in scope for the review itself. Each is either a larger perf change needing its own PR with benchmarks, or a judgment call worth revisiting with fresh eyes.

## 3. Parallel root sweep

**Where:** `daemon._sweep_once` iterates `roots` sequentially.

**Why:** users with both a personal and business Dropbox have two independent subtrees. Sweep wall-clock is `sum(per_root)` instead of `max(per_root)`.

**Shape of fix:** `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(roots))`. Independent roots write to disjoint keys in `_rules`, but the dict itself needs a lock (or per-root caches). Low urgency — most users have one root, and the savings are wall-clock, not CPU.

## 4. Double reconcile on same-directory `.dropboxignore` rename

**Where:** `daemon._dispatch` RULES moved branch (`daemon.py` around L58–67).

**Why:** the current code reconciles `src.parent` unconditionally, then reloads the dest and reconciles again if the parent differs. In the most common case (pure rename inside the same directory), `src.parent == dest.parent`, so the first reconcile runs with the *old* cache state — partly stale, then redone moments later. One wasted subtree walk per in-place rename.

**Shape of fix:** before the unconditional `reconcile_subtree(root, src.parent, cache)`, check whether `src.parent == (dest.parent if dest_in_root else None)`; if so, skip straight to `remove_file(src)` + `reload_file(dest)` + single reconcile.

**Risk:** small — the path is well-tested. Worth adding a test that counts reconcile calls for the same-directory rename case before shipping.

## Non-deferrals (decided not to pursue)

- **Fold `_ancestors` into `_applicable`**: cosmetic, no concrete payoff.
- **Merge `test_daemon_logging.py::isolated_pkg_logger` fixture with `_configured_logging`**: fixture installs a *sentinel* state for assertions, not pure dup of the context manager.
- **Unify ad-hoc ADS test stubs in `test_reconcile_return_state.py`**: four local stubs of ≤8 lines each; unifying would add indirection worse than the local code.
- **Extract a move-dest helper in `_dispatch`**: two 7-line blocks with genuinely different logic (rules events need `reload_file`, other events don't). Premature abstraction.
